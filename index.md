**Introduction**


**Motivation**
In order to improve the comfort, wellness, and health of workers, we want to create a smart office sensor system. During a normal workday, the temperature is constantly varying, in the morning it can be cold, you can have the windows closed but during the afternoon the weather can change completely, and connecting and disconnecting fans or opening or closing windows is inefficient and disturbs the work of employees since these are tasks that no one additionally wants to do. At this time with the current COVID 19 pandemic situation it is important to measure CO2 in an office and to alert opening windows or excess people when there are more people than recommended to prevent contagion. On the other hand, offices are currently not energy efficient since even when there is only one worker at his workstation, all the lights in his area are on, and this is not optimal in a world with limited resources for future generations.

**Goals**
- Control the fan so it automatically turns on when the DHT11  Temperature and Humidity  detects temperatures higher than 25 degrees Celsius  (77 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Automation of the lightning in an office to increase energy efficiency through the use of the HC-SR501 Infrared PIR Motion Sensor Module.
- Send an alert, which in this project would be to turn one LED on when the  Adafruit SCD-30 - NDIR CO2, Temperature and Humidity sensor detects 1000 ppm.
