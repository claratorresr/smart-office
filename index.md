**Introduction**


**Motivation**

In order to improve the comfort, wellness, and health of workers, we want to create a smart office sensor system. During a typical workday, the temperature fluctuates dramatically, especially during the fall or spring seasons; it can be cold in the morning but drastically change in the afternoon. Connecting and disconnecting fans, as well as opening and closing windows, is inefficient and interrupts employees' workflow. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to monitor CO2  levels in offices and to alert employees when windows should be opened and when there are more people than recommended to prevent contagion. On the other hand, many offices are currently not energy efficient because they lack an energy-control system that optimizes electricity use, resulting in significant energy waste.

**Goals**
- Activate the fan automatically when the DHT11  Temperature and Humidity sensor detects temperatures higher than 25 degrees Celsius  (77 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Automate the lighting system in an office to improve energy efficiency using the HC-SR501 Infrared PIR Motion Sensor Module.
- Alert the people when the Adafruit SCD-30 - NDIR CO2, Temperature and Humidity sensor detects 1000 ppm. In this project, an LED light will be turned on in response to an excessive amount of CO2.


***Review of the Phenomena of Interest***

**Physical Principles**

**Temperature:**
It is a physical quantity that quantifies hot and cold. It is the manifestation of thermal energy present in all matter. The temperature is measured with thermometers that are calibrated in different temperature scales that have used various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. However, the human perception of hotness or coldness is relative. For instance, people living in colder climates like in Greenland may consider a cold temperature as low as -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), whereas people living in Brazil may consider the cold temperature as low as less than 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). The lowest theoretical temperature is absolute zero, which means that at this temperature, no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica).

**CO2:**
Carbon Dioxide or CO2 is a greenhouse gas that is natural and harmless when it is presented in small quantities, but if its level rises, it can affect productivity and sleep quality. Its density is 53% higher than that of dry air and its molecules consist of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. This gas is produced mostly in indoor spaces by the air people exhale, and its levels concentrate with less ventilation. Nowadays, buildings have implemented ventilation systems that recycle air and move the contaminated air around rather than cycling in new air, which results in high levels of CO2 concentration and poor indoor air quality. Moreover, CO2 emissions are the primary driver of global climate change, and it is widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the globe needs to lower these CO2 emissions (Ritchie & Roser).

**Motion:**
Motion is the action of changing location or position. There are three main types of motion. Translational motion means that an object is moving in a translational direction, changing its location instead of not going anywhere. The oscillatory motion is repetitive and fluctuates between two locations, which are considered oscillatory movements; a very common example of this motion is the pendulum. This type of motion is interesting because it is considered to be periodic in time. The term type of motion is rotational. This one occurs when an object spins, for example, the Earth or the Sun (The Physics Hypertextbook).

**For Progress Report**
First report by (10/1/2021):
-Additional sensor SCD-30 - NDIR CO2, Temperature and Humidity sensor and a miniature 5V cooling fan were ordered form Adafru.it.
-The team started creating the code to meet our 3 main goals, measure temperature, detect motion to turn on lights and detect high CO2 levels

Problems Encountered
September 28,2021:
-
-One of the goals of this project is to measure the CO2 levels, but the sensor was not avaiable. The soluction to this was to order it from Audifrut.
