During a typical workday, the temperature fluctuates dramatically, especially during the fall or spring seasons; it can be cold in the morning but drastically change in the afternoon. Connecting and disconnecting fans, as well as opening and closing windows, is inefficient and interrupts employees' workflow. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to monitor CO2 levels in offices and to alert employees when windows should be opened and when there are more people than recommended to prevent contagion. On the other hand, many offices are currently not energy efficient because they lack an energy-control system that optimizes electricity use, resulting in significant energy waste. Therefore, this project is a low cost solution for office spaces created from scratch and available to the public.
